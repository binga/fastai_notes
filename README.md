I am selected for the International Fellowship offered by [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) (University of San Francisco) to attend the Deep Learning Class (v2) October 2017 cohort. This class is taught by [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel).

I am currently attending the program remotely from India. This repository contains all my classnotes, experiments, reproducible notebooks for various Kaggle / AI / Computer Vision Challenges.
